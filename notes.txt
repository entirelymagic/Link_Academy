Lists = *************************************

.append('value') value to the end of the element
.remove('value') - YOu can only remove the value of the element from the list
.pop(2)  will remove the 3rd element from the sequence = can be assigned (x = list_.pop(2)
.de;l list_[2]  remove the 3rd element from the sequence  = cannot be assigned
.clear() remove all the elements from the list

Examples:
arr = [6,7,8]

for i in range(len(arr)): # i will be the index
    print(arr[i])

for k,v in enumerate(arr): # k will be the index(key), v will be the value
    print(v, "is on index", k)

Slice = *************************************

Can be applied a sequence:

Examples:
x = [0,1,2,3,4]
Sliced Object = ['start', 'stop', 'step']  ## The 'stop' element is not included!!!

y = x[1,3]  # [1, 2]

Sorting = *************************************

.sort() object must be iterable.
 |  sort(self, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)
 |      Sort the list in ascending order and return None.
 |
 |      The sort is in-place (i.e. the list itself is modified) and stable (i.e. the
 |      order of two equal elements is maintained).
 |
 |      If a key function is given, apply it once to each list item and sort them,
 |      ascending or descending, according to their function values.
 |
 |      The reverse flag can be set to sort in descending order.
